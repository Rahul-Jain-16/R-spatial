------------

In this section we will look at some libraries and commands that allow us to process spatial data in R and perform a few examples of commonly used operations.

## Attribute Join

An attribute join brings tabular data into a geographic context. It refers to the process of joining data in tabular format to data in a format that holds the geometries (polygon, line, or point). 

If you have done attribute joins of shapefiles in GIS software like _ArcGIS_ or _QGis_ you know that you need a __unique identifier__ in both the attribute table of the shapefile and the table to be joined. 

In order to combine a `Spatial*Dataframe` with another table (which would be a dataframe in R) we do exactly the same. We have a `Spatial*Dataframe`[^5] that contains the geometries and an identifying index variable for each. We combine it with a dataframe, that includes the same index variable with additional variables.

[^5]: Per the [ESRI specification](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf) a shapefile always has an attribute table, so when we read it into R with the `readOGR` command from the `sp` package it automatically becomes a `Spatial*Dataframe` and the attribute table becomes the dataframe.

![Attribute Join of countryData table to worldCountries using unique ID variables](img/attrJoin.png)

The `sp` package has a `merge` command which extends the base `merge` command to works with `Spatial*` objects as argument.

[^4]: The `geo_join()` command from the [`tigris` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/index.html) also provides a convenient way to merge a data frame to a spatial data frame.

Assume we have:

* a `SpatialPolygonObject` named _worldCountries_, and
* a dataframe called _countryData_ with the attribute data to join

where:

* _"id-number"_ is the colum that contains the unique identifier in _worldCountries_, and 
* _"countryID"_ is the column that contains the unique identifier in _countryData_. 

We would then say:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(sp) # make sure that is loaded
worldCountries <- merge(worldCountries, countryData, by.x = "id-number", by.y = "countryID")
```

(You may come across alternative suggestions for joins that operate on the data slot `@data` of the Spatial* object. While they may work, we don't suggest them here, as good practice suggests not to use the slot explicitly if at all possible.)

  
Load the CSV table `PhiladelphiaEduAttain.csv` into a dataframe in R and name it `ph_edu`.

```{r load-edu-csv}
ph_edu <- read.csv("data/PhiladelphiaEduAttain.csv")
names(ph_edu)
```


Read the `PhillyTotalPopHHinc` shapefile into an object named `philly_sf`. Check out the column names of `philly_sf` and and of `ph_edu` to determine which one might contain the unique identifier for the join.

```{r load-philly-sf}
## sf ##
# if you need to read in again:
# philly_sf <- st_read("data/Philly/")
names(philly_sf)
```

Join the `ph_edu` data frame with `philly` using `merge` as described above. Use the `names()` command to see if the join was successful.

```{r sf-attr-join, results='show'}
# this is base::merge()
philly_sf_merged <- merge(philly_sf, ph_edu, by.x = "GEOID10", by.y = "GEOID")
names(philly_sf_merged) # note the geometry column
```


The same with  `sp`

```{r load-philly-sp, results='show'}
## sp ##
# if you need to read in again:
# philly_sp <- readOGR("data/Philly/", "PhillyTotalPopHHinc") 

# this is sp::merge()
philly_sp_merged <- merge(philly_sp, ph_edu, by.x = "GEOID10", by.y = "GEOID")

names(philly_sp_merged) # no geometry column here
```


## Reprojecting 

Not unfrequently you may have to reproject spatial objects that you perhaps have acquired from various sources and that you need to be in the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The functions that do this typically take the following two arguments:

  * the spatial object to reproject
  * a CRS object with the new projection definition

You can reproject

  - a `Spatial*` object with `spTransform()` 
  - a `sf` object with `st_transform()`
  - a `raster` object with `projectRaster()`

The perhaps trickiest part here is to determine the definition of the projection, which needs to be a character string in [proj4](http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/) format. You can [look it up online](http://www.spatialreference.org). For example for [UTM zone 33N (EPSG:32633)](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-33n/) the string would be:

[`+proj=utm +zone=33 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-33n/proj4js/)

You can retrieve the CRS: 

  - from an existing `Spatial*` object with `proj4string()` 
  - from an `sf` object with `st_crs()`
  - from a `raster` object with `crs()`

Let us now go back to the homicide shapefile we exported to `"PhillyHomicides"`. Let's read it back in and transform it so it matches the projection of the Philadelphia Census tracts. We will assign it to a new object called `ph_homic_aea_`.

First we read it in and check the CRS for both files. Then we use the respective transformation functions to reproject.

```{r vector-reproject, results='show'}
## sf ##
ph_homic_sf <- st_read("data/PhillyHomicides/")
st_crs(philly_sf)
st_crs(ph_homic_sf)
ph_homic_aea_sf <- st_transform(ph_homic_sf, st_crs(philly_sf))

## sp ##
ph_homic_sp <- readOGR("data/PhillyHomicides/", "PhillyHomicides")
proj4string(philly_sp)
proj4string(ph_homic_sp)
ph_homic_aea_sp <- spTransform(ph_homic_sp, CRS(proj4string(philly_sp)))
```

We can use the `range()` command from the R base package to compare the coordinates before and after reprojection and confirm that you actually have transformed them. `range()` simply returns the _min_ and _max_ value of a vector of numbers that you give it. So you can check with:  

```{r, compare-coords-range, results='show'}
range(st_coordinates(ph_homic_aea_sf))
range(st_coordinates(ph_homic_sf))

range(coordinates(ph_homic_aea_sp))
range(coordinates(ph_homic_sp))
```

 
We can also compare them visually with:  

```{r compare-reproj-plots, results='show'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
plot(ph_homic_aea_sp, axes=TRUE)
plot(ph_homic_sp, axes=TRUE)
```


Here is what it would look like to reproject the HARV raster used earlier to a WGS84 projection.

```{r raster-reproject, tidy=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='show'}
# if you need to load again:
#HARV <- raster("data/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
crs(HARV)
HARV.WGS84 <- projectRaster(HARV, crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")
plot(HARV); plot(HARV.WGS84)
```



## Points in Polygons

For the next exercise we want to calculate the density of homicides for each census tract in Philadelphia as

    number of homicides per census tract / area per census tract

To achieve this this we join the points of homicide incidence to the census tract polygon. You might be familiar with this operation from other GIS packages.

For `sp` objects we can use the `aggregate()` function[^6]. Here are the arguments that it needs:

* the `SpatialPointDataframe`with the homicide incidents as point locations,
* the `SpatialPolygonDataframe` with the census tract polygons to aggregate on, and
* an aggregate function. Since we are interested in counting the points (i.e. the rows of all the points that belong to a certain polygon), we can use length (of the respective vectors of the aggregated data). 


[^6]: There is also an `aggregate()` function in the `stats` package that comes with the R standard install. Note that `sp` extends this function so it can take `Spatial*` objects and aggregate over the geometric features.



Let's do this.

To count homicides per census tract we can use any field from `ph_homic_aea` for homicide incidents (we chose  `OBJ_ID`) and `philly` polygons to aggregate on and save the result as `ph_hom_count`. Use `length` as aggregate function. 

```{r aggregate-sp, results='show'}
ph_hom_count_sp <- aggregate(x = ph_homic_aea_sp["OBJ_ID"], by = philly_sp, FUN = length)
# make sure we understand this error message:
# aggregate(x = ph_homic_sp, by = philly_sp, FUN = length) 
```


Now let us investigate the object we created.

```{r inspect-aggr-sp, results='show'}
class(ph_hom_count_sp)
names(ph_hom_count_sp)
head(ph_hom_count_sp)
```


Now we can calculate the density of homicides in Philadelphia, normalized over the area for each census tract.

We use `gArea()` from the `rgeos` library. `gArea`, when given a `SpatialPolygon`, calculates the size of the area covered. If we need that calculation for each polygon, we set `byid = TRUE`. Units are in map units.


```{r sp-crime-rate, results='show'}
library(rgeos)
# we multiply by by 1000000 to get sq km.
ph_hom_count_sp$homic_dens <- 1e6 * (ph_hom_count_sp$OBJ_ID/gArea(ph_hom_count_sp, byid = FALSE))

hist(ph_hom_count_sp$homic_dens)
```


We will write it out for later. (Note that this will produce an error if the file already exists. You can force it to write out with the option `overwrite_layer = TRUE`)

```{r sp-crime-write, eval=FALSE}
writeOGR(ph_hom_count_sp, "data/PhillyCrimerate", "PhillyCrimerate", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```

There might be other instances where we don't want to aggregate, but might only want to know which polygon a point falls into. In that case we can use `over()`. In fact, the `aggregate()` function used above makes use of `over()`. See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/vignettes/over.pdf for more details on the over-methods. `point.in.poly()` from the [`spatialEco`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spatialEco) package intersects point and polygons and adds polygon attributes to points. There is also `point.in.polygon()` from the `sp` package which tests if a point or set of points fall in a given polygon.


For `sf` objects we need to add one more step. We first use `st_within()` to determine which polygon a points falls into. We can then use the result to aggregate.

>>> Need to add this

```{r sf-hom-ratio, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
##use st_intersects?
point_in_poly <- st_within(ph_crime_aea_sf, philly_sf) # determine which poly each point falls into
pp <- as.numeric(as.character(point_in_poly)) # we need a vector
ph_hom_count_sf <- aggregate(ph_crime_aea_sf["OBJECTID"], list(pp), length)
# fix this: the aggregate does not come up with the same length
hist(ph_hom_count_sf$OBJECTID/philly_sf$totalPop)
```



## Select Polygons by Location

For the next example our goal is to select all Philadelphia census tracts within a range of 2 kilometers from the city center.

> Think about this for a moment -- what might be the steps you'd follow?

```{r eval=FALSE}
## How about:

# 1. Get the census tract polygons.
# 2. Find the Philadelphia city center coordinates.
# 3. Create a buffer around the city center point.
# 4. Select all census tract polygons that intersect with the center buffer

```

### Using the `sp` package

In order to perform those operations on an `sp` object we will need to make use of an additional package, called `rgeos`. Make sure you have it loaded. 

```{r}
library(rgeos)
# if you need to read it in again
# philly_sp <- readOGR("data/Philly/", "PhillyTotalPopHHinc", verbose = F)
```

We will use `philly_sp` for the census tract polygons.

In addition, we need to create a `SpatialPoints` object with the Philadelphia city center coordinates.  

Lat is 39.95258 and Lon is -75.16522. This is in WGS84.  

With this information, we create a `SpatialPoints` object named `philly_ctr`.  
```{r sp-ph-center, results='show'}
coords <- data.frame(x = -75.16522, y = 39.95258) # set the coordinates
prj <- CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs") # the projection string for WGS84
philly_ctr <- SpatialPoints(coords, proj4string = prj) # create the spatialPoints
```

Next, we create a buffer around the city center point.  
Here is where we will use the `gBuffer()` function from the `rgeos` package. For this purpose we will need to provide two arguments: the __sp object__ and the __width__ of the buffer, which is assumed to be in map units. The function returns a `SpatialPolygons` object to you with the buffer - name it `philly_buf`.  
So our command would look something like  
```
philly_buf <- gBuffer(the_spatial_point_object, width = a_number_here)
```  
__Now -- before we create this buffer, think about what you need to do to `philly_ctr` before you proceed.__

```{r sp-buffer, results='show'}
philly_ctr_aea <- spTransform(philly_ctr, CRS(proj4string(philly_sp))) # reproject!!
philly_buf <- gBuffer(philly_ctr_aea, width=2000)  # create buffer around center
```

Ok. Now we can use that buffer to select all census tract polygons that intersect with the center buffer.

We will use the `gIntersects()` function from the `rgeos` package for this. The function tests if two geometries (let's name them _spgeom1_ and _spgeom2_) have points in common or not. `gIntersects` returns TRUE if _spgeom1_ and _spgeom2_ have at least one point in common.  

Here is where we determine if the census tracts fall within the buffer. In addition to our two `sp` objects (`philly_buf` and `philly_sp`) we need to provide one more argument, `byid`. It determines if the function should be applied across ids (TRUE) or the entire object (FALSE) for _spgeom1_ and _spgeom2_. The default setting is FALSE. Since we want to compare _every single_ census tract polygon in our `philly_sp` object we need to set it to TRUE.  

```{r sp-intersect, results='show'}
philly_buf_intersects <-  gIntersects (philly_buf, philly_sp, byid=TRUE) # determine which census tracts intersect with the buffer

# what kind of object is this?
class(philly_buf_intersects)

# subset
philly_sel <- philly_sp[as.vector(philly_buf_intersects),]
```

Finally, we plot it all.

```{r sp-plot-selection, results = 'show'}
plot (philly_sp, border="#aaaaaa")
plot (philly_sel, add=T, col="red") 
plot (philly_buf, add=T, lwd = 2)
```

### Using the `sf` package

To give you a sense of how this might be done using the `sf` package we will reproduce here the same example as above. 

For the spatial operations we can recur to the suite of geometric operations that come with the `sf` package , in particular we will use `st_buffer()` and `st_intersects()`

```{r sf-intersect, results='show'}
library(sf)
philly_sf <- st_read("data/Philly/", quiet = T)

# make a simple feature point with CRS
philly_ctr_sfc <- st_sfc(st_point(c(-75.16522, 39.95258)), crs = 4326)

# reproject
philly_ctr_aea_sf <- st_transform(philly_ctr_sfc, st_crs(philly_sf))

# create buffer
philly_buf_sf <- st_buffer(philly_ctr_aea_sf, 2000)

# find intersection between buffer and census polygons
philly_buf_intersects <- st_intersects(philly_buf_sf, philly_sf)
class(philly_buf_intersects)

# subset
philly_sel_sf <- philly_sf[unlist(philly_buf_intersects),]

# plot
plot(st_geometry(philly_sf), border="#aaaaaa")
plot(st_geometry(philly_sel_sf), add=T, col="red")
plot(st_geometry(philly_buf_sf), add=T, lwd = 2)
```
