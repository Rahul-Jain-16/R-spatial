# Prerequisites and Preparations {-}

To get the most out of this workshop you should have:

- a **basic knowledge** of R and/or be familiar with the topics covered in the [Introduction to R](https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/).
- have a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. 

**Recommended**: 

- Create a new RStudio project `R-spatial` in a new folder `R-spatial`.

- Create a new folder under `R-spatial` and call it `data`. 

- If you have your working directory set to `R-spatial` which contains a folder called `data` you can copy, paste, and run the following lines in R:

```{r download-files, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/cengel/R-spatial/raw/master/data/R-spatial-data.zip", 
              "R-spatial-data.zip")
unzip("R-spatial-data.zip", exdir = "data")
```

You can also download the data manually here [R-spatial-data.zip](https://github.com/cengel/R-spatial/raw/master/data/R-spatial-data.zip) and extract them.
 
- Open up a new R Script file `R-spatial.R` for the code you'll create during the workshop.

- Install and load the following libraries: 
    - [`sp`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) (version 1.2-7)
    - [`rgdal`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal) (version 1.2-18)
    - [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) (Mac use binary of version 0.6-1)
    - [`raster`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster) (version 2.6-7)
    - [`rgeos`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgeos) (version 0.3-26)

- For the mapping section install and load these additional libraries:
    - [`classInt`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=classInt)
    - [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RColorBrewer)
    - [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom)
    - [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)
    - [`ggmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggmap)
    - [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmap)
    - [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet)
